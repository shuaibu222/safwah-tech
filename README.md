## Overview

- this is my mind-designed project to implementation

### Why this project?

- This is a funny project amongst my first full websites built from scratch, trying to use a warm accent to build it.

### How do I get unstuck when am stuck

- Most a time I search and go through the code and understand it finding the bug and correct it.

### My process

- I follow the website page by page because it's a mind-desined website. I just think of a company name and just put it into work without even wireframing because I feel excited sitting in front of my Macbook building CSS awesome stuffs.

### My challenges

- Using hover on SVGs and using dataset feature in Javascript.

### What I learned
